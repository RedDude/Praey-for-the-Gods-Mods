I got the bad habit to draw the grapple hook too early sometimes. I was think about it, and my guess was that a grapple hook aim like the Batman Askham one would help a lot in this factor. So, I did a mod that always show the grapple hook aim when the Hook is equipment. Me and a few friends, who already played the game and one that just started, though was quite cool and helpful.
